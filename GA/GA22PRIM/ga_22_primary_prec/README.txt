## Additional Notes
Files were checked against separate statewide and countywide election result files also available from the Georgia Secretary of State. Results matched exactly except for differences below.

Georgia Secretary of State summary files had no reported votes for the following contests:
Cook County - G22COANBAR, G22COANMCF, G22COANPIP, G22SSSCNMCM, G22SSCNLAG, G22SSCNCOL, G22SSCNBRI
Grady County - PCON02DBIS
Mitchell County - PCON02DBIS
Thomas County - PSL173RTAY, PSL173DSR
In all instances where the SOS county-level file had no reported votes in a contest in a specific county, vote numbers from the precinct-level compiled dataset are presumed to be accurate and included in this dataset.

Georgia Secretary of State summary files had no reported data for the following contest:
Grady County - PCON02DOHA
Mitchell County - PCON02DOHA
In this instance, we believe this candidate received zero votes in these counties because votes for other candidates were reported at the precinct level in this contest.
However, we are unable to confirm, since there is no reported data for this candidate, in these counties.

Georgia Secretary of State summary files had equal vote total discrepancies in the following contests:
Pickens County - 9 votes swapped between G22SSCNMCM and G22SSCNLAG contests
Whitfield County - 16 votes swapped between G22SSCNMCM and G22SSCNLAG contests
The vote discrepancies in Pickens and Whitfield county seem to indicate swapping of 9 and 16 votes in each county respectively. We are unable to determine whether this error originated at the precinct, or county level. Given the differences found in other contests in the Secretary of State's county-level file, we are unable to support it's accuracy. We have chosen to leave the precinct-level vote totals unaltered in these contests.
